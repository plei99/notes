## Technical Details
Currently, notes are typed **during** lecture in `neovim` with the `vimtex` LateX package. The LaTeX details are:
-   I use `LuaLaTeX`, load `fontspec`, and use the Libertinus font
-   Math is in Libertinus using `unicode-math`
-   `microtype` is used for microtypographical improvements
