# Course Notes

These are the (live-TeXed unless noted otherwise) notes for various
graduate math courses and seminars that I attended as an undergrad or
grad student. If you find any errors, do not hesitate to email me or
submit a pull request. 

If you treat this as an entire body of work, then anyone who has taken
undergrad algebra and analysis can read and understand the material in
these notes. However, the notes are most definitely not self-contained,
even if you treat them together as a single text (for example, some
definitions that were included as remarks during class and I was already
comfortable with at the time are deliberately omitted).

Please note that the overall exposition of some of the 
courses/seminars/individual lectures was not very good.
