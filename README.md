## Technical Details
There were several stages of technical changes.
-   First, I used the `article` class with default font and `fancyhdr` for headers.
-   Next, I switched to `lualatex` and the `memoir` class, used the `Libertinus` font, and used `microtype` for microtypographical enhancements.
-   Now, I use the `Palatino` font through the `mathpazo` package with `microtype` and the `memoir class`
